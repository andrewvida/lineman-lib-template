# lineman-lib-template

This is a template project for [Lineman](http://linemanjs.org) designed for releasing JavaScript libraries for the web.

It's basically a normal Lineman project with all the non-JS default tasks removed.

**NOTE:** At present, all your vendor libs will be rolled in with your distribution. That's not super awesome.
